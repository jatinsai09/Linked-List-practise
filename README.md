Linked List Practise 🧠

A collection of C++ implementations and practice problems for the Linked List data structure. This repository contains multiple source files demonstrating common linked list operations like insertion, deletion, reversal, and finding the middle node using manual implementations.

📌 What’s Inside

This repo includes:

LL-insertion.cpp – Code for inserting nodes into a linked list

LL-deletion.cpp – Code for deleting nodes from a linked list

LL-reverse.cpp – Code to reverse a linked list

LL-find-middle.cpp – Finding the middle node of a linked list

DLL-insertion.cpp – Insertion in a doubly linked list

All programs are written in C++ and focus on basic linked list algorithms.

🧩 Concepts Covered

Singly and Doubly Linked List operations

Node creation and traversal

Insertion at different positions

Deletion of nodes

List reversal

Middle element detection

These implementations help reinforce understanding of pointers, dynamic memory, and fundamental data structure logic.
